            Mustang is an ancient forbidden kingdom, bordered by the Tibetan Plateau and sheltered by 
            some of world's tallest peaks, including 8000-meter tall Annapurna and Dhaulagiri.
            Strict regulations of tourists here have aided in maintaining Tibetan traditions.
            Upper Mustang was a restricted demilitarized area until 1992, which makes it one of 
            the most preserved regions in the world due to its relative isolation from the outside world,
            with a majority of the population still speaking traditional Tibetic languages.

            Agriculture and animal husbandry are the main occupations.The entire district is included 
            within the Annapurna Conservation Area, the largest protected area of Nepal.Development 
            programmes, tourism management, and so on are primarily overseen by the Annapurna Conservation 
            Area Project (ACAP), a division of the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC).
            The kingdom of Mustang was a dependency of the Kingdom of Nepal since 1795, but was 
            abolished by the republican Government of Nepal on October 7, 2008.
