            of area, it is the capital city of Gandaki Pradesh. The city also serves as the headquarters
            of Kaski District.Pokhara is located 200 kilometres (120 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu.

            Pokhara is in the northwestern corner of the Pokhara Valley, which is a widening of the 
            Seti Gandaki valley that lies in the region (Pahad) of the Himalayas. In this region the mountains 
            rise very quickly, and within 30 kilometres (19 miles), the elevation rises from 1,000 to 7,500 metres
            (3,300 to 24,600 feet). As a result of this sharp rise in altitude the area of Pokhara has one of the
            highest precipitation rates in the country (3,350 mm/year or 131 inches/year in the valley to
            5600 mm/year or 222 inches/year in Lumle).

                The Seti Gandaki is the main river flowing through the city. The Seti Gandaki (White Gandaki)
                and its tributaries have created several gorges and canyons in and around Pokhara that give
                intriguingly long sections of terrace features to the city and surrounding areas. 
                These long sections of terraces are interrupted by gorges that are hundreds of metres deep.
